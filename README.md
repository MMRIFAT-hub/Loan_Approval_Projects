# Loan Approval Projects

This repository contains multiple machine learning and statistical analysis projects focused on predicting loan approvals and understanding the key factors influencing them.  
Each project explores different approaches, datasets, and evaluation techniques to develop robust, interpretable models.

## üìä Datasets

The datasets used in these projects are loan approval‚Äìrelated, containing applicant demographic, financial, and loan-related details.  
They are preprocessed to handle:
- Missing values
- Categorical encoding
- Outlier treatment
- Train-test splitting

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Languages & Libraries**  
  - Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost)
  - Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
  
- **Algorithms**  
  - Random Forest
  - Linear Regression
  - XGBoost
  - AdaBoost
  - Logistic Regression
  - Statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA)

## üìà Workflow Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features
   - Feature scaling (if required)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations of feature distributions
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Target variable distribution

3. **Model Development**
   - Train various ML algorithms
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix
   - ROC-AUC score
   - Feature importance plots

5. **Statistical Testing**
   - t-tests to compare feature means
   - ANOVA for multi-group significance
